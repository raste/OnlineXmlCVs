# Online Xml CVs

### About

A simple site for uploading and browsing CVs in XML format.

It was given as recruitment task with the following objectives:
-  Page for uploading CV in XML format, which is stored in database.
-  Page with list of already uploaded CVs, with person's name and link to detailed CV page.
-  Page for detailed view of the CV.
-  Development period of up to 2 weeks.

It was written in 3 days. The project also has validation of the XML's (no XSD/DTD used) with detailed error messages and option to upload CV's in English and Bulgarian languages.

Seems that it wasn't worth enough and I wasn't recruited :(
